# Dask Image Watershed

Attempts at producing a distributed parallel version of the skimage watershed algorithm. See https://github.com/dask/dask-image/pull/99 for more information and discussion.

Right now it appears this may not be possible. If it is possible, the machinery to make it work effectively doesn't exist yet.
